       "17  Inclusion Criteria:#        Potential participants must meet the following inclusion criteria:#          -  Be within 3-months of diagnosis of type 1 diabetes based on American Diabetes             Association (ADA) criteria#          -  Be between the ages of 8 and 45 years old#          -  Must have stimulated C-peptide levels > 0.2 pmol/ml (measured during an MMTT             administered no more than one month prior to the date of randomization)#          -  Must have either detectable anti-GAD, anti-ICA512/IA-2, insulin autoantibodies             (unless received insulin therapy for 7 days or more), or islet cell autoantibodies.#        [The reason for inclusion of these enrollment criteria is to avoid inclusion of patients        with \"Type 1B diabetes mellitus\", which may not involve the immunologic criteria measured        by the assays that will be utilized.]#          -  If participant has reproductive potential, he or she must be agreeable to an             effective form of birth control (unless abstinence is the chosen method).#          -  If participant is female with reproductive potential, she must be willing to undergo             pregnancy testing and to report possible or confirmed pregnancies promptly during the             course of the MMF/DZB study.#          -  Must be willing to comply with intensive diabetes management.  The goal of management             will be an HbA1c of  7.0% for all participants, regardless of age.  Participants will             be expected to take a sufficient number of daily insulin shots to meet this goal.             Alternatively, participants can use insulin pump therapy.  Participants will also be             expected to test their blood sugar at least 3-4 times per day.  There will be a             Certified Diabetes Educator working with study participants to achieve these goals.#        Exclusion Criteria:#        Potential participants must not meet any of the following exclusion criteria:#          -  Have any complicating medical issues that would interfere with blood drawing or             monitoring.#          -  Have a Body Mass Index (BMI) that is greater than the 95th percentile for age and             gender.#          -  Have serologic evidence of HIV infection.#          -  Have serologic evidence of Hepatitis B infection.#          -  Have serologic evidence of Hepatitis C infection.#          -  Have abnormal liver function tests.#          -  Have a history of leukopenia and/or neutropenia.#          -  Have a history of chronic peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis, chronic             inflammatory bowel disease and/or chronic colonic disease.#          -  Have a positive PPD test result.#          -  Have had any live vaccinations in the preceding 6 weeks (e.g. MMR-second dose, live             flu vaccine, varicella vaccine, live polio vaccine, yellow fever vaccine).#          -  Resides outside reasonable geographical proximity to the clinic (i.e., residence             outside the state in which the Investigator and study reside, residence outside an             immediately neighboring state, or residence outside an area that the Investigator             considers reasonable). It is left to the Investigator's discretion to decide if a             patient's geographical residence is prohibitive to complete study participation.#          -  Require chronic use of steroids or other immunosuppressive agents for other             conditions.#          -  Be currently pregnant or 3 months postpartum.#          -  Be currently nursing or within 6 weeks of having completed nursing.#          -  Anticipate getting pregnant, or fathering a child, during the study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "94  Inclusion Criteria:#        Patients must reside in the Philadelphia area and participate in regular in person visits        to the Jefferson Diabetes Research Center. Patients must be at the stage of their        treatment where they are going to initiate insulin infusion pump therapy. Patients must be        at least 18 years of age before starting the protocol and must have never used an insulin        pump before.  Ideally, at least a few of the study participants will use English as a        second language.  Since the technology is capable of delivering messages to the wireless        email device in several languages including Spanish and French, there is no English only        requirement.  Likewise, patients not capable of operating the wireless email device will        be included since the GlucoMON device is specially designed to enable patient use without        technology aptitude typical for personal computers and interactive wireless devices.#        Exclusion Criteria:#        Patients living outside the Philadelphia area and those that are not immediately going to        initiate insulin pump therapy wil be excluded. Patients unwilling to perform at least 4        blood glucose self-tests will be ineligible for participation in this study.

       "96  Inclusion Criteria:#        - Enrolling subjects must have Type 1 diabetes mellitus for more than 5 years, complicated        by at least one of the following situations that persist despite intensive insulin        management efforts.  (Intensive management is defined as monitoring of glucose values at        home no less than three times each day and by the administration of three or more insulin        injections each day.  Such management must be monitored in close cooperation with an        endocrinologist or primary care physician, as defined by at least three contacts during        the previous 12 months. If an endocrinologist did not participate in the ongoing        management effort during the past year, then an independent endocrinologist must assess        the adequacy of the management efforts prior to enrollment.)  The complicating situations        are:#        a. Reduced awareness of hypoglycemia, as defined by the absence of adequate autonomic        symptoms at plasma glucose levels of < 54 mg/dL, b. Metabolic lability/instability,        characterized by two or more episodes of severe hypoglycemia and which is associated with        a blood glucose below 54 mg/dl OR two or more hospital visits for diabetic ketoacidosis        over the last year, c. Despite efforts at optimal glucose control, progressive secondary        complications of diabetes as defined by: i) Retinopathy—a minimum of a three step        progression using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grading system        44,or an equivalent progression as certified by an ophthalmologist familiar with diabetic        retinopathy, or ii) Nephropathy—a confirmed rise of 50 µg/min (72 mg/24h) of        microalbuminuria or greater over at least three months (beginning anytime within the past        two years) despite the use of an ACE inhibitor, or iii) Neuropathy—persistent or        progressing autonomic neuropathy (gastroparesis, postural hypotension, neuropathic bowel        or bladder) or persistent or progressing severe peripheral painful neuropathy not        responding to usual management (e.g., tricyclics, gabapentin, or carbamazepine).#        Exclusion Criteria:#          1. Severe co-existing cardiac disease, characterized by any one of these conditions:#               -  Recent myocardial infarction (within past six months), or#               -  Angiographic evidence of non-correctable coronary artery disease, or#               -  Evidence of ischemia on functional cardiac exam (functional testing is required                  for all subjects, with a stress echo test recommended for subjects with a                  history of ischemic disease).  Patients unable to perform an exercise stress                  echocardiogram test will undergo adenosine vasodilator stress test, and if there                  is a history of bronchospasm, will undergo dobutamine stress test.#          2. Active alcohol or substance abuse-includes cigarette smoking (must be abstinent for             six months).  Active alcohol abuse should be considered using the current NIAAA             definitions, whereby alcohol abuse is defined by a pattern of drinking that is             accompanied by one or more of the following situations within a 12-month period:#               -  Failure to fulfill major work, school, or home responsibilities;#               -  Drinking in situations that are physically dangerous, such as while driving a                  car or operating machinery;#               -  Recurring alcohol-related legal problems, such as being arrested for driving                  under the influence of alcohol or for physically hurting someone while drunk;#               -  Continued drinking despite having ongoing relationship problems that are caused                  or worsened by the effects of alcohol.#          3. Psychiatric disorder making the subject not a suitable candidate for transplantation,             e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression that is unstable or             uncontrolled on current medication.  (A psychological or psychiatric consultation is             required only if considered necessary by some current indication or history.)#          4.
